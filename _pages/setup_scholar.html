<p>The following instructions presuppose that you already have a functioning website buil using Jekyll and github-pages.</p>

<h3>Step 1: Include jekyll-scholar as plugin</h3>

<p>To add Jekyll-scholar to your website, you must update the Gemfile (<i>Gemfile</i>) and the configuration file (<i>_config.yml</i>) in your main website repository.
</p>
<p><b>Changes to Gemfile</b><br>Add the following line of code:<br>
  <code>gem 'jekyll-scholar', group: jekyll_plugins</code></p>

<p>
  <b>Changes to configuration file</b><br>Add the following lines of code:<br> 
  <pre>
    <code>
      plugins:
        - jekyll-scholar
     </code>
  </pre>
</p>

<h3>Step 2: Set up github action</h3>

<p>
  For security reasons, github does not, by default, allow the loading of just any kind of Jekyll plugin when building your website. 
  The solution is to set up a continuous integration pipeline to build the site on each push and publish the build output on the master branch.
  GitHub Actions allow us to do just that. We define our own build action in the following steps: 
</p>
  
<p>
  <b>Generate a new <i>source</i> branch</b>: Generate a branch called <i>source</i> to which you move all files currently located on the <i>main/master</i> branch.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Add your new Github action</b>: On your <i>sourcce</i> branch, create a new folder called <i>.github/workflows</i>. Within that folder, create a new file called <i>build.yml</i>.<br>
  Copy the contents of <a href="https://github.com/julianeRS/julianers.github.io/blob/source/.github/workflows/build.yml"><b>this file</b></a> into it.<br>
  You may have to adapt this code by updating the Ruby version (line 19).
</p>  

  <h3>Step 3: Configure citations with Jekyll-scholar</h3>
  <p>By default, Jekyll-scholar expects to find a bibliography file called <i>references.bib</i> in a <i>_bibliography</i> folder of your <i>source</i> branch.
   If necessary, we can override these settings by changing the plugin settings in the <i>_config.yml</i> file (see the readme</b> at 
   <a href="https://github.com/inukshuk/jekyll-scholar"><b>https://github.com/inukshuk/jekyll-scholar</b></a>). For now, we will just keep it like that.</p>

<p><b>Add your .bib file</b>: Create a new folder <i>_bibliography</i> containing a file <i>references.bib</i>. From now on, you can use Jekyll-scholar commands as indicated
  <a href="https://julianers.github.io/examples-scholar/"><b>here</b></a>
