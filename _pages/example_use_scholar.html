 <p>In the following, I will demonstrate basic commands of the Jekyll-scholar plugin. <b>For details, please see the readme</b> on 
   <a href="https://github.com/inukshuk/jekyll-scholar"><b>https://github.com/inukshuk/jekyll-scholar</b></a>
</p>

  <h3> Basic setup</h3>
  <p> I have included a .bib file in the source branch of the website repository (<a href="https://github.com/julianeRS/julianers.github.io/blob/source/_bibliography/references.bib"<b>see here</b></a>. 
 Jekyll-scholar also supports the use of several .bib files; in that case the scholar plugin settings in the _config.yml file need to be updated accordingly.</p>

A github action ensures that the website build will be automatically updated on every push to the source branch. Thus, if you modify a .bib file whose entries are printed as a bibliography
somewhere on the website, the html generated from the .bib build automatically updates along with it. Jekyll-scholar also allows for the use of in-text citations and formatted references, cross-references to other 
pages on the wbsite and more using commands similar to LaTeX citation commands.
    
  <h3>In-text citations</h3>
<p>
To cite entries from the source .bib file, you can use the following base command:
  <br>
  {% raw %}{% cite bibentry %}{% endraw %}
  <br>
  This will result in a citation like this: {% cite schwab_2020 %}
</p>
<p>
  You can cite multiple items in a single citation by referencing all ids of the items you wish to quote separated by spaces. For example, 
 <code>{% raw %}{% cite example1 example2 % }{% endraw %}</code> would produce something like this:
  <br>
  {% cite schwab_2020 schwab_processing_2022%}
</p>
Suppressing author names, adding page numbers, ..., are possible with additional specifiers in the <i>cite</i> command. See the readme file linked above.  
  
<h3>Formatted references and bibliography</h3>
<p> To print a full formatted reference (as we may wish to do to display all lab publications), use the <i>reference</i> tag:
  <br>
  {% raw %}{% reference bibentry %}{% endraw %}
<br>
  This will produce a full bibliography entry like so:
  <br>
  {% reference schwab_processing_2022 %}
  
  <h3>Bibliography</h3>
<p> The full bibliography file, or all cited entries, can be printed with the <i>bibliography</i> command. Bibliography and citation styles can be changed with user-specified .css files.</p>

{% raw %}{% bibliography --cited %}{% endraw %}
<br>
{% bibliography --cited %}
