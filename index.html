        <h2>About me</h2>

        <p> My name is Juliane Schwab, I am a PhD candidate in the DFG-funded Research Training Group <a href<a href="https://www.comco.uni-osnabrueck.de/en/startpage.html"><i>Computational Cognition</i></a> 
        at the Institute of Cognitive Science in Osnabr√ºck, Germany.
            I am supervised by Prof. Dr. Mingya Liu (Humboldt University of Berlin) and Prof. Dr. Jutta L. Mueller (University of Vienna).
          In my project, I investigate the semantics, pragmatics, and processing of polarity items using psycho- and neurolinguistic methods. 
          </p>  
                        
        <p>In my research, I aim for an interdisciplinary perspective, combining methods and insights from theoretical linguistics, psycho- and neurolinguistics, and Bayesian statistical modelling to elucidate natural language and its processing in the human mind.
                I am broadly interested in the semantics/pragmatics interface and the cognitive mechanisms involved in language processing. 
                Currently, my work focuses on processing at the sentence and discourse level.  </p>
