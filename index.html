        <h2>About me</h2>

        <p> My name is Juliane Schwab, I am a PhD candidate in the DFG-funded Research Training Group 
                <a href<a href="http://computational-cognition.eu/">"Computational Cognition"</a>
                at the <a href<a href="https://www.ikw.uni-osnabrueck.de/en/home.html">Institute of Cognitive Science</a> in Osnabrück, Germany.
            I am supervised by Prof. Dr. Mingya Liu (Humboldt University of Berlin) and Prof. Dr. Jutta L. Mueller (Osnabrück University).
          In my project, I investigate the semantics and pragmatics of negative and positive polarity items using psycho- and neurolinguistic methods. 
          </p>  
                        
        <p>I am passionate about the importance of combining theoretical and experimental perspectives when studying human language.
                I am broadly interested in the semantics and pragmatics of natural language, and the cognitive mechanisms, including the roles of expectations and memory, in language processing. 
        Currently, my research focuses on language processing at the sentence and discourse level.  </p>
