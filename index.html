        <h2>About me</h2>

        <p> My name is Juliane Schwab, I am a PhD candidate in the DFG-funded Research Training Group <i>Computational Cognition</i>
                at the <a href<a href="https://www.ikw.uni-osnabrueck.de/en/home.html">Institute of Cognitive Science</a> in Osnabr√ºck, Germany.
            I am supervised by Prof. Dr. Mingya Liu (Humboldt University of Berlin) and Prof. Dr. Jutta L. Mueller (University of Vienna).
          In my project, I investigate the semantics and pragmatics of negative and positive polarity items using psycho- and neurolinguistic methods. 
          </p>  
                        
        <p>For my research, I try to combine insights from theoretical linguistics, psycho-/neurolinguistic research, and computational modeling, for a better understanding of human natural language and its users.
                I am broadly interested in the semantics and pragmatics of natural language, and the cognitive mechanisms involved in language processing. 
        Currently, my research focuses on language processing at the sentence and discourse level.  </p>
